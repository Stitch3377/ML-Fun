# ML Playground

Here is a repository of my exploration with small ML projects! This repository is a collection of small machine learning projects that Iâ€™m exploring for fun and to learn more about ML and LLMs! Each project lives in its own file/folder and focuses on experimenting with different ML concepts, libraries, or applications.

## ðŸ“Œ Projects

### 1. Text-to-Image Generation (Stable Diffusion)

A simple Python application that generates images from text prompts using [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/sd-legacy/stable-diffusion-v1-5) via the Hugging Face `diffusers` library. Unlike cloud-based APIs, this project runs the Stable Diffusion model locally on your GPU using PyTorch, giving full control and faster generation if you have CUDA available.

**Features:**
- Generate images from natural language prompts.
- Runs the model locally on your GPU (no API calls required).
- Preview generated images directly.
- Option to save images with a custom filename.
- Run interactively in the terminal.

## ðŸ“… Future Projects?

* Integrate image gen app with webhooks

* Finetuning an LLM model

* Whatever else seems fun!

## ðŸ“š Notes

These projects are for learning and exploration only.
Iâ€™m experimenting, breaking things, and documenting my progress here.

Feel free to explore, fork, or suggest fun ideas! ðŸš€
